-- #3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers

-- #4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT product, min(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Jan
GROUP BY product, price
ORDER BY price ASC

-- #5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity)*price as revenue

SELECT count(distinct cust.acctnum),
